""" Sophia is organizing a list of event IDs that represent consecutive days of an event. She needs to group these IDs into consecutive sequences. For example, if the IDs 3, 4, and 5 appear consecutively, they should be grouped together. 



Write a program that helps Sophia by reading the total number of event IDs and the IDs themselves, then display each group of consecutive IDs in tuple format.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of event IDs.

The next n lines contain integers representing the event IDs, where each integer corresponds to an event ID.

Output format :
The output should display each group of consecutive event IDs in a tuple format. Each group should be printed on a new line, and single event IDs should be displayed as a single-element tuple."""

# Read the size of the tuple
n = int(input())

# Read the tuple elements
elements = []
for _ in range(n):
    elements.append(int(input()))

# Convert list to tuple
input_tuple = tuple(elements)

# Initialize variables
result = []
current_group = [input_tuple[0]]

# Iterate through the tuple to group consecutive integers
for i in range(1, len(input_tuple)):
    if input_tuple[i] == input_tuple[i - 1] + 1:
        current_group.append(input_tuple[i])
    else:
        result.append(tuple(current_group))
        current_group = [input_tuple[i]]

# Append the last group
result.append(tuple(current_group))

# Print the result with proper formatting
for group in result:
    if len(group) == 1:
        print(f"({group[0]})")
    else:
        print(group)
